1- Vertex: Each node of the graph is called a vertex. In the above graph, A, B, C, and D are the vertices of the graph.
2- Edge: The link or path between two vertices is called an edge. It connects two or more vertices. The different edges in the above graph are AB, BC, AD, and DC.
3- Adjacent node: In a graph, if two nodes are connected by an edge then they are called adjacent nodes or neighbors. In the above graph, vertices A and B are connected by edge AB. Thus A and B are adjacent nodes.
4- Degree of the node: The number of edges that are connected to a particular node is called the degree of the node. In the above graph, node A has a degree 2.
5- Path: The sequence of nodes that we need to follow when we have to travel from one vertex to another in a graph is called the path. In our example graph, if we need to go from node A to C, then the path would be A->B->C.
6- Closed path: If the initial node is the same as a terminal node, then that path is termed as the closed path.
7- Simple path: A closed path in which all the other nodes are distinct is called a simple path.
8- Cycle: A path in which there are no repeated edges or vertices and the first and last vertices are the same is called a cycle. In the above graph, A->B->C->D->A is a cycle.
9- Connected Graph: A connected graph is the one in which there is a path between each of the vertices. This means that there is not a single vertex which is isolated or without a connecting edge. The graph shown above is a connected graph.
10- Complete Graph: A graph in which each node is connected to another is called the Complete graph. If N is the total number of nodes in a graph then the complete graph contains N(N-1)/2 number of edges.
11- Weighted graph: A positive value assigned to each edge indicating its length (distance between the vertices connected by an edge) is called weight. The graph containing weighted edges is called a weighted graph. The weight of an edge e is denoted by w(e) and it indicates the cost of traversing an edge.
12- Diagraph: A digraph is a graph in which every edge is associated with a specific direction and the traversal can be done in specified direction only.
